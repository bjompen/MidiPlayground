# PSMidi playground

Midi 2.0 is coming to Windows 11 - and you can read all about that [here](https://microsoft.github.io/MIDI/)

This is my playground for things and stuff with Midi 2.0.

~~Eventually this will be a module for fun/dumb/use(full|less) things to do with Midi in PowerShell. It is surprisingly fun.~~

Module can be found [here](https://github.com/bjompen/PSMidi)
